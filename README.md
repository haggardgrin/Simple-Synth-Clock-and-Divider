# Simple-Synth-Clock-and-Divider
Arduino Nano based clock and divider for synthesizers

Easy to build and cheap. As always, many mods are possible. You could reduce the number of outputs if you don't want or need them. A smart person would probably include a reset output, though I did not. Coming soon - AE modular / 5v unipolar version of schematic.
